# Report Processing Project

## Description

This project processes member and payment data to generate reports on membership and payment activity. It performs the following tasks:

1. **Data Loading:** Loads member data from a CSV file and payment data from an Excel file.
2. **Data Cleaning and Transformation:** Cleans and transforms the data, including converting data types and merging datasets.
3. **Report Generation:** Generates reports on total payments per ward and payment activity by group, including member counts and total amounts paid.
4. **Data Export:** Exports the generated reports to Excel files.

## Installation

1. **Install Required Libraries:** Make sure you have the following libraries installed:
2. **Upload Data Files:** Upload your 'Members.csv' and 'PaymentsJan.xlsx' files to your Google Colab environment. Ensure they are accessible via the specified paths in the code.

## Usage

1. **Open the Colab Notebook:** Open the provided Colab notebook.
2. **Update File Paths:** Replace the placeholder file paths with the actual paths to your data files.
3. **Run the Code:** Execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially.
4. **View and Download Reports:** View the generated reports within the notebook. Downloaded reports will be saved in the Colab environment.

## Output

The project generates the following output files:

- `total_payments_per_ward.xlsx`: Contains the total payments made per ward.
- `group_nama_ward_member_size_paid.xlsx`: Contains group-wise payment activity, including total member count, total members paid, and total amount paid.

## Potential Adjustments

This section outlines potential enhancements to improve the data processing pipeline.

### Data Validation

* **Duplicate NationalID Check:** Add a check to ensure no duplicate NationalID values exist in the members dataset.
* **Data Type Validation:** Verify the data types of key columns (e.g., ID Number, NationalID, Account no) to prevent errors.
* **Range Validation:** Consider adding range checks for numerical fields (e.g., AMOUNT PAID).

### Error Handling

* **Graceful Exception Handling:** Improve error handling using try-except blocks and logging.
* **Data Quality Alerts:** Implement alerts for missing values or invalid data formats.

### Visualizations

* **Interactive Charts:** Include visualizations like bar charts or line charts using Matplotlib or Seaborn.
* **Payment Trends:** Visualize payment trends over time, grouped by Group Name or Ward.

### Automation

* **Scheduled Runs:** Automate the pipeline using a script or workflow management tool.
* **Trigger-Based Execution:** Trigger the pipeline automatically when new data becomes available.

### Reporting Portal

* **Interactive Dashboard:** Develop a web-based report portal using Flask for interactive data exploration.
* **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication to control access to the portal.
* **Real-Time Updates:** Integrate real-time data updates for the most current information.
